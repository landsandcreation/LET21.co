  For comfort and safety purposes, we are unable to accommodate any luggage with dimensions exceeding this standard <strong>(25”x15”x15) per ticket</strong>. All guests are entitled to one medium sized luggage. In cases where specific guest(s) luggage exceeds this requirement, affected guests will be asked to purchase an extra seat to accommodate it.
  Also flexible/plastic traveling boxes are not acceptable in our vehicle. This is because these boxes are not only fragile but also difficult to manipulate which poses a challenge during luggage loading activities.
  Owing to the embargo placed by the Nigeria Customs on the importation of some food commodities, kindly note that we do not carry bag(s) of rice on board our vehicles. Fragile items such as electronics, laptops and other valuable items are not to be placed in the trunk of our vehicles but carried as hand luggage.
